# #  AUTOLIB HYPOTHESIS TESTING
#### A Jupyter notebook
#### By **Sharon Faith**
## Description
The notebook contains the analysis on a project whose objective was to determine whether the average number of blue cars taken (provided by Autolib company) during weekends in the 9th-20th arrondissements of Paris is greater than the average number taken in the 1st-8th arrondissements during the weekend. These insights will help in accurately informing Autolib's strategies of resource distribution across the different districts on weekends.
